Owership is a set of rules that govern how rust programs manage memory.

Memory consists of: stack and heap.

The stack and heap are parts of memory available for a program's code to use from runtime.

With ownership, "memory safety" is guaranteed without the need for a garbage collector.

Ownership rules:
1. Every value in Rust has a variable known as the "owner"
2. There can be only one owner at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, its value is dropped
